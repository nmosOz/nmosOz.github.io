    <p> My favorite project I have done (so far). Myself and four others worked on this project throughout the semester.
        We were tasked with making an application that was to be loaded on a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a video camera and 
        deployed about a couple hundred feet off shore of Lake Ontario. We had to collaborate with the Biology department
        to plan out their specific requirements for the application and what could resonably be done in one semester. The 
        resulting program was one that could correctly identify and track movements, by movements I mean if the fish was moving 
        to the left, right, towards, or backwards, in specifically Round Gobies which are invasive in the lake. The program was in 2
        parts, the first part just took a 30-minute video and then sent it to a dedicated server. The other was hosted on that dedicated 
        server which had a watchdog program that would detect when a new video was sent to it for processing. 
        Once processed the program would spit out a .csv file containing time, date, direction, and number of fish in the frame.

    <h3> Collaborative Text Editor </h3>
    <p> This project is exactly what the title sounds like. A simple, collaborative text editor in Java. This was made using Kafka for message transmission.
        Every user that connects needed to be able to transmit and receive messages (possibly at the same time), which means every user must be both 
        a Kafka 'producer' and 'consumer'. The user has access to simple text-based actions like adding, removing, and pasting messages at the same time 
        other users are doing the same thing, all while keeping each user's document's synced. This program does have a few bugs still as we were only given about five 
        weeks to complete it, but I wanted to show it off as it was a program I really liked working on.

    <p> This was a website made for adoption agencies to post 'profiles' of animals they had up for adoption.
        This class consisted of about 25 people all working in collaboration to make the website over the semester.
        We were able to pick a different team to determine what part of the website to focus on.
        I chose to be part of the 'Engine' team. This team was in charge of handling API calls made by the front-end 
        and storing the data for each animal shelter or pet. In this class we used AGILE development rather than the 
        traditional waterfall method used in classes. Overall this class taught me how to work in a team and be able to 
        collaborate with other teams that may not know how our code works.
