        <h2> Background: </h2>
        <p> I am from Baldwinsville, NY and have lived there my whole life.
            When I was in 8th grade I took a robotics class and have loved 
            programming ever since. I graduated from SUNY OCC in May of 2022
            and went on to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
            from SUNY Oswego and graduated in May of 2024. 
        </p>
        <p> In college I was part of the Computer Science Club and the Math Club. 
            I liked doing work in the computer science lounge as I could collaborate
            with fellow students as well as help others that needed it.
        </p>
        <p> My strongest languages are SQL (including mySQL and other SQL plugins in Python), 
            Java and Python. However, I have made projects with many others including C, Go, 
            Clojure, and OCaml. I love learning new programming languages and new things that 
            are possible within the languages I already know!
        </p>

        <h2>
            What am I doing now?
        </h2>
        <p> I am currently looking for a job that will get me a foothold in the tech industry. 
            While job searching I am working on projects I didn't have the time to work on during
            college. 
        </p>
